# polaris
A base project for demonstrating User Account Management (with SSO) via React, Redux, and Firebase.  Intended as a base project for several years of webapps to come.  Using a todo list as the CRUD "hello world"

Why Polaris?  Because this is meant to be my "Guiding Star".  I get annoyed by how difficult it is to get "up and running" these days when in 20 minutes I could get to "the fun part" with a LAMP stack and some dirty, dirty PHP.
